            The&#160;first successful North American transcontinental trip by
            automobile took place in 1903, and was piloted by H. Nelson Jackson
            and Sewall K. Crocker, accompanied by a&#160;canine named Bud.
            The&#160;trip was completed using a&#160;1903 Winton Touring Car,
            dubbed &#8220;Vermont&#8221; by Jackson. The&#160;trip took
            a&#160;total of 63 days between San Francisco and New York, and
            cost US$8,000. The&#160;total cost included items such as food,
            gasoline, lodging, tires, parts, other supplies, and the&#160;cost
            of the&#160;Winton.

            The&#160;first woman to cross the&#160;American landscape by car
            was Alice Ramsey with three female passengers in 1909. Ramsey left
            from Hell&#8217;s Gate in Manhattan, New York and traveled 59 days
            to San Francisco, California. Ramsey was followed in 1910 by
            Blanche Stuart Scott, who is&#160;often mistakenly cited as
            the&#160;first woman to make the&#160;cross-country journey by
            automobile East-to-West (but was a&#160;true pioneer in aviation).

        <blockquote>
            &#8230;on the&#160;lost art of the&#160;great American road trip
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            New highways in the&#160;early 1900s helped propel automobile
            travel in the&#160;United States, primarily cross-country travel.
            Commissioned in 1926, and completely paved near the&#160;end of
            the&#160;1930s, Route 66 is&#160;a&#160;living icon of early modern
            road tripping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Motorists ventured cross-country for holiday as well as migrating
            to California and other locations. The&#160;modern American road
            trip began to take shape in the&#160;late 1930s and into
            the&#160;1940s, ushering in an&#160;era of a&#160;nation on
            the&#160;move.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a&#160;result of this new vacation-by-road style, many
            businesses began to cater to road-weary travelers. More reliable
            vehicles and services made long distance road trips easier for
            families, as the&#160;length of time required to cross
            the&#160;continent was reduced from months to days. Within one
            week, the&#160;average family can travel to destinations across
            North America.
        </p>
        <p>
            The&#160;greatest change to the&#160;American road trip was
            the&#160;start, and subsequent expansion, of the&#160;Interstate
            Highway System. The&#160;higher speeds and controlled access nature
            of the&#160;Interstate allowed for greater distances to be traveled
            in less time and with improved safety as highways became divided.
        </p>
        <p>
            So many people connected with our trip in so many ways and we have
            been an&#160;inspiration to many to hit the&#160;road or follow
            their dreams. Some of those we inspired were inspired to beat our
            record and accomplished just that. The&#160;trip was great,
            the&#160;sense of accomplishment was wonderful but knowing we might
            have made a&#160;difference in someone&#8217;s day, let alone life,
            is&#160;better than any record.
        </p>
        <p>
            Travelers from European countries, Australia and elsewhere soon
            came to the&#160;US to take part in the&#160;American idea of
            a&#160;road trip.
        </p>
